Tic Tac Toe Android App
===

This is a simple Android Application implementing the game Tic Tac Toe.

It only makes use of native Android libraries making it a good starting point for learning parts of the Android API.

The code here has been created by Lyndon Armitage.
If you want to use the code feel free, provided you arenâ€™t making money off of it or calling it your own (it took me time and effort to make it after all).
